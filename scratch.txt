List of fixes:

    limit zero input to one digit
    limit character input but still allow operation
 
 
 
 make storage array
 have default display be 0
 add each input sent to a display array (or string?)
 when number inputs, add to compute array using for loop
 when the input is an operator
  store the operator choice as op
  take everything before the operator, concatinate and store it as number a.
  clear compute array
  then take more numbers
  if input is another operator && a > 0, 
      cat and store the numbers as a
  if equal sign is used, 
      take each number before equals, concatinate and store it as b
  perform operation on a, op, and b.
  store the result as a
  display result on screen

  when computing multiple operations
  if event is operator
    if a is not undefined
        splice the array to b
        join
        operate
